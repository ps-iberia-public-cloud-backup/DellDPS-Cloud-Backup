Environment Variables: The environment block in Jenkinsfile defines variables similar to those in the Ansible playbook. These can be overridden by Jenkins parameters or set in the Jenkins UI.

Prepare Environment: The chmod +x command ensures that the setup.sh script is executable.

Execute setup.sh: The command variable is constructed by appending necessary parameters. Optional parameters are included conditionally, similar to the Ansible playbook.

Display Setup Output: This stage is used to display any output from the setup.sh script, assuming it writes output to a file.

Post Actions: The post block handles cleanup and archiving of any generated files, ensuring that the workspace is cleaned up after the pipeline execution.
